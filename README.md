# Selected-SDSS-Spectrometry
Spectral analysis on selection of 30 galaxies near 3C 273.
For each of the objects in the SDSS search, a wavelength versus flux plot with notable emission and absorption features annotated will be created. These features are then checked against known rest values to determine the redshift of the object. A Hubble diagram is created using all of the analyzed objects.
Can optionally plot the provided sky spectra taken with each object.

Requires spectra, a search table, and the list of spectral features from SDSS.
